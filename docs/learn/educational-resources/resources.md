## What is a Tezos Wallet

It's basically just a safe place to store Tez and tokens such as NFTs. 
The wallet holds the secret data needed to send your coins; it's similar to your bank account, but instead of relying on the bank to hold dollars, you rely on your ability to recall or find passwords, and hold tez.

When you log in to your wallet, you can see any previous transactions, the account number (or wallet address), which begins with the letters 'tz' and you can send those funds to other Tezos accounts. You can (and should) also choose a delegate to earn regular rewards from a baker.

When setting up a new Tezos wallet with Kukai for example, there are three different ways.

**Easiest method**
Sign in with a social media account.
If you're not a passphrase kind of person, you may prefer to start an account that links to your social media account. 
There is no need to keep track of a backup or passphrase. Your wallet access depends on keeping your social media account. Make sure your social media account has two-factor authentication turned on.

**Normal method**
Create a new wallet and keep the backup phrase safe and away from electronic devices and other people.

**Expert method**
Use a Ledger Nano S or Nano X and connect Kukai to your Ledger. Your backup phrase will be generated on the Ledger and you can use multiple Tezos accounts by using custom derivation paths. Just make sure to keep track of the paths. For example, 44'/1729'/0'/0'/0' = Rainy day fund
44'/1729'/0'/0'/1' = Travel fund
44'/1729'/0'/0'/2' = Parent's account

### Create a Wallet

Creating a wallet is simple and secure with [Kukai](https://wallet.kukai.app/), a mobile friendly wallet that you can take anywhere. Creating one is as easy as having a Twitter, Facebook, Google, or Reddit account. 

### Add Tez to your wallet
You can add Tezos into your wallet from either a centralized exchange (where you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies with fiat, the national currency you use every day) or by transfering Tez from another Tezos wallet. When transferring Tez or other tokens such as NFTs there will be a network fee and a storage fee when transfering NFTs.

### Wallet Security

* Never share your passphrase
* *If* you create a wallet with a social media account and lose access (banned or lose your password) from that account, you will lose access to your wallet. (Typically used to only hold small amounts of Tez)
* A downloadable file which contains a version of your backup phrase encrypted with your strong passphrase is available with Kukai. It's worth storing this on a USB stick in case you lose your backup phrase. 
* Always double check you are using the correct website - wallet.kukai.app - and check any tz address matches after copy/paste
* You can improve your security by using an additional passphrase on a Ledger which will ensure anyone who steals the physical backup phrase would not have access to the funds without the passphrase too.
* Store your passphrase in a safe physical locations of both the Kukai backup phrase and the Ledger passphrase.

**Always remember:** If you do not control your private keys, you do not control your tokens. Every user should make sure to exercise extreme care and take all available safety precautions when entering private key information anywhere. Any party or software, such as a wallet, that gains knowledge of private key information will have access to the tez controlled by the corresponding public key hash.
