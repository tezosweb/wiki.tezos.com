# Morley

[Morley](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/blob/master/code/morley/README.md) is a Haskell-based framework for meta-programming Michelson smart contracts.

It consists of:

* The Morley language: a superset of the Michelson language, with a simpler syntax and some simple features.

  Contracts are written in `.mtz` files.

* A library with the core Tezos and Michelson data types, as well as tools for typechecking,

  interpreting, parsing and printing Michelson and Morley contracts.

* An executable with commands for compiling and working with Morley and Michelson contracts,

  along with a REPL for interactively running instructions.

It's the founding library of [Lorentz](/learn/smartcontracts/morley-framework/lorentz), [Indigo](/learn/smartcontracts/morley-framework/indigo), [Cleveland](/learn/smartcontracts/morley-framework/cleveland) as well as related tools and utilities.
